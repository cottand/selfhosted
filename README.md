# [Self-hosted fleet](https://nico.dcotta.eu/projects/selfhosted-homelab)

This is the config-as-code of my personal machine cluster, which I use to self-host some services, including [my personal website](https://nico.dcotta.eu/projects/selfhosted-homelab).

**You can find write-up of the set-up and architecture [here](https://nico.dcotta.eu/projects/selfhosted-homelab).**

The fleet is made up of
- a few small servers hosted by Contabo, in Germany
- a few small servers hosted by Hetzner, in Germany
- 2 old machines in London, UK (in my living room)
- 1 old laptop in Madrid, Spain (this one is in my parents' living room)
- Cloudlfare proxies my public HTTP traffic


The technologies I use include
- [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) for the connection between nodes, so _all_ cluster communication is private and secure
- [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) for orchestrating containers, netwkoring, and storage
- [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) for automating and storing secrets, including mTLS between services and my own ACME authority
- [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) for service discovery and service-mesh orchestration
- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) for managing the bare-metal (and [Colmena](https://github.com/zhaofengli/colmena) for deploying remotely)
- [SeaweedFS](https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs) as a distributed filesystem to manage highly available persistent storage
- [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach) for HA distributed SQL databases
- [Leng](https://github.com/cottand/leng) (which I maintain myself) for DNS service-discovery and adblocking

I always set up the HA versions of the above. This means Raft storage for Vault, erasure coding for SeaweedFS, etc.

Configuration management is done declaratively, with Terraform (for the stateful services) and Nix (for the OS and package management).
